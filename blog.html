        Question 1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
      </h2>
      <p id="q-1" class="p-5 text-xl">
        Ans: Let and const both of them are block-scope. They can only use
        within the block they are defined. Both of them provide maintainability
        and bebugging which is an advantage over var. Var dont have block scope.
        Var is either function-scoped or global scope which can result in
        unexpected behavior.

        Question 2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
      </h2>
      <p id="q-2" class="p-5 text-xl">
        Ans: When a variable dont have value undefined is used such as
        uninitialized variables or missing function parameter. Null is used to
        show that a variable or attribute has no value on purpose. So we have
        use undefined and null property with care to avoid any error in the code

      </h2>

        Ans: A collection of guidelines for creating and utilizing web services
        is known as a REST API. It makes use of conventional HTTP techniques
        like GET and POST to access and change web resources. It maintains to
        status and standard interface ideas for reliable and scalable
